# 🌌 TIM'S GRAVITY-DEFYING NEXUS 🌌

Welcome to **Nexus**, a professional-grade, end-to-end encrypted chat gateway designed for absolute privacy and global accessibility. Built, hosted, and maintained by **Timothy Wambua (Tim)**.

## 🚀 The Master Connection (Client v3.0)
The Nexus now uses **SSL Tunneling** to ensure your messages bypass all internet service provider (ISP) filters and firewalls.

- **Server Hostname:** `nexus-main.fly.dev`
- **Secure Port:** `443` (Standard SSL)
- **Required Credential:** You only need the shared **Encryption Password** to unlock communication.

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements
Nexus is a Python-based platform that depends on two main libraries for its "Harvester" aesthetic and cryptographic security.

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install rich cryptography
```

### 2. How to Run
```bash
python3 client.py
```
*When prompted, simply press **Enter** to accept the default Hostname and Port.*

## 💻 New Architecture: SSL Tunneling
The latest version of Nexus features a "Master Solution" for connectivity issues:
- **Port 443 Integration**: Messages are wrapped in a Secure Socket Layer (SSL), making your chat traffic look like standard, safe web browsing.
- **Dedicated Security**: By using SSL, the system bypasses aggressive cloud proxies and ISP "Broken Pipe" errors.
- **Headless Cloud Stability**: The server detects when it's running in the cloud (Fly.io) and optimizes its performance for 24/7 uptime.

---

## ✨ Key Advantages
- **Double Encryption**: Your messages are first encrypted with your secret key, then wrapped again in an SSL tunnel.
- **Zero-Footprint Server**: The server has NO database. Your messages exist in RAM for only a millisecond before being delivered and destroyed.
- **Hacker Aesthetic**: A fully optimized terminal UI with the "TIM NEXUS" ASCII banner and green Matrix theme.
- **Global Availability**: No tunneling software (ngrok) is required. It works anywhere in the world.
